We learned about the micro:bit's power to message.You can send anything you like, as long as it is not a voice messege!Your micro:bit can also communicate with other micro:bits to  do actions through radio.You, however, must press the right button to send the right messege.It can also show diffrent signals based on your code and the recieved messege.This is all I know, until next time!
